# jDeploy

Developer friendly desktop deployment tool.  See [the jDeploy Website](https://www.jdeploy.com) for usage instructions.

## GitHub Action Instructions

The jdeploy github action allows you to generate native desktop installers for your Java project in a Github workflow.  This action can be run for both commits and releases.  

If used on a commit to a branch, it will publish the the app installers to a release named after the branch. E.g. For the "master" branch, it would post installers to a tag named "master".  If used on a "tag", it will simply add the installers as artifacts of the release.  In both cases it will add some download links to the release notes.

### Example Usage

IMPORTANT: For this action to work, you must first configure your project with jDeploy, as described in [the jDeploy Developer Guide](https://www.jdeploy.com/docs/manual/).  

Add the following to your workflow in a step *after* the app has been built.

```yaml
- name: Build App Installer Bundles
  uses: actions/jdeploy@master
  with:
    github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

If this is run on "commit", then it will create or update a release with the same name as the branch.  If this is run on a tag or release, it will add the installers as artifacts to the release.  In both cases, it appends notes to the release with download links.

[See example release](https://github.com/shannah/jdeploy-javafx-starter/releases/tag/master)

### Example Workflow

```yaml
# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven and bundle them as native app installers with jDeploy
# See https://www.jdeploy.com for more information.

name: jDeploy CI with Maven

on:
  push:
    branches: ['*']
    tags: ['*']

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: maven
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml

          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

### Example Project

The [jDeploy JavaFX Starter Project](https://github.com/shannah/jdeploy-javafx-starter) is a template repository for a JavaFX application.  It comes pre-configured with this workflow to generate both snapshot builds for each branch, and release builds.
