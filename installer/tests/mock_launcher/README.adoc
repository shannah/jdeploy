= Mock jDeploy Launcher

This directory contains a "mock" launcher for jDeploy that is used for the purposes of running integration tests on the jDeploy Installer.

== Usage

Copy the correct launcher into the project directory (see samples in the installer/tests/shellmarks and installer/tests/snapcodejava directories).

Then run the launcher with either the "install" or "uninstall" CLI arguments.

Use the mock_launcher.sh on Mac and Linux.  Use mock_launcher_win.exe on Windows.

== Building Windows Launcher

In order to be compatible with the jDeploy Windows uninstaller, the launcher needed to be an .exe, and not a shell or batch script, so the launcher is written in C.

See `mock_launcher_win.c` for the source code.

To build this launcher simply run `build.sh`
